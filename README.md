1st design - Coding with Ash
So this is the first in a series of designs i am coding with Ashley (Brilliant babe fr)
I encountered problems trying to get the navbar to show up on desktop, still haven't fixed that.
and the hero section on mobile is a little wonky with the spacing.

But i learnt some more about animations, and positioning.
Pain points include:
- Grid
- Responsiveness
- Animations
